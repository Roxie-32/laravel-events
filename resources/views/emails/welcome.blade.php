# Welcome to the Sample Newsletter

Thanks for joining the weekly Sample Newsletter. Each issue is sent every Sunday at 8 AM EST and 
it includes links to all the latest happenings in the Sample world and elsewhere. I try to curate the best items so you can 
quickly scan and find things that are interesting and useful. It's the best way of quickly staying up to date.  


Thanks,<br>
